Guidelines & Notes for Team Members
1. Naming Conventions
•	Variable Names:
o	Use descriptive names for variables like (total_expenditure instead of x or y).
o	Use snake_case for variables (life_expectancy ).
•	Function Names:
o	Use descriptive names for function (total_adult_mortality).
o	Use snake_case for function names (total_adult_mortality).
2. Functions
•	Function Definition:
o	Break the code into smaller functions if possible to avoid repetition.
o	Each function should perform one task.
•	Arguments and Returns:
o	functions should have clear arguments and return values that align with their purpose.
3. Commenting
o	Use comments to explain the logic of any non-trivial code (loops and conditionals in particular).
o	Add comments for each function to describe what it does, its input parameters, and what it returns.
Code Sharing:
o	Use GitHub for version control to share code updates.
o	Use Notion for task alignment and Project Management.
o	If you and I are working on the same file, use branches to avoid merge conflicts.
