# coefficients:

1- (**Intercept**): The model predicts that when all variables GDP, schooling, and total expenditure are zero and statusis Developed (baseline) , life expectancy equals 45.67 years. and for **intercept** The p-value is less than 5% , which indicates that this estimate is statistically significant.

2- GDP: The model shows that for each unit increase in GDP, life expectancy increases by 8.576e-05 years, holding all other factors constant and status is Developed (baseline). The  p-value less than 5% indicates a statistically significant relationship between GDP and life expectancy and we can reject null hypothesis.

3- status (Developing) -1.465e+00 :  is This is the difference in the intercept between "Developed" and "Developing", holding all other variables GDP, schooling, and total expenditure zero. The p-value is 0.0041, which shows this estimate is statistically significant.

schooling: The model shows that for each unit increase in schooling, life expectancy increases by 2.041e+00 years, holding all other factors constant and status = "Developed" . The v p-value (less than %5) indicates a statistically significant relationship between life expectency and Schooling.

total_expenditure: The model Shows that for each unit increase in total expenditure, the life expectancy decreases by 5.722e-02 years. However, the p-value of 0.3857 higher than 5% which means  that this effect is not statistically significant we can not reject null hypothesis.

#Residual standard error:
1- Residual standard error is 5.942 This is a measure of the variability of the residuals, which means that the Residual are not spread out in the model
2- Multiple R-squared: 0.5449 This means that the model explains 54.49% of the variance in life expectency, wich is not very high


#R- Squared

the model shows that Multiple R-squared = 0.5449 which means the variance in the life_expectancy that is explained by the independent variables (gdp, total_expenditure....) is  54.49% of the variability in life expectancy can be explained by the model. and Adjusted R-squaredis different from Multiple R-squared because the model have more than one predictor and Adjusted R-squared of 54.38% indicates that after accounting for the number of predictors, the model still explains about 54.38% of the variance in life expectancy which is less than Multiple R-squared which means the model includes unnecessary predictors.


# Multicollinearity for the multi_model_gdp_status model

```{r}

# show the corelation in the model
cor( WHO[,c("gdp" ,"schooling" , "total_expenditure")])


```
1- From the correlation matrix above, we can see that GDP and schooling are correlated, with a correlation estimate of 0.4679470. Therefore, we will remove one of them. Based on the correlation estimate, the relationship between total expenditure and GDP is less than that of schooling and total expenditure, so we will remove schooling from the model.

#coeffectient

**Intercept**: The model predicts that when all variables (GDP and total expenditure) are zero, life expectancy equals 6.525e+01  years. The p-value is less than 5%, which indicates that this estimate is statistically significant.

**GDP**: The model shows that for each unit increase in GDP, life expectancy increases by 3.247e-04 years, holding all other factors constant. The p-value is less than 5%, indicating a statistically significant relationship between GDP and life expectancy, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis.

**Total Expenditure**: The model indicates that for each unit increase in total expenditure, life expectancy increases by 3.761e-01 years, holding all other factors constant. The p-value of 1.16e-05 is less than 5%, which means that this estimate is statistically significant, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis.

#R-Squared

1- The model shows that the Multiple R-squared is 0.2041 which means that the variance in life expectancy explained by the independent variables (GDP and total expenditure) is 20.41%. which is not a big number. The Adjusted R-squared of 0.2031 is slightly lower, indicating that after accounting for the number of predictors, the model explains about 20.31% of the variance in life expectancy. 

# Interactions Between  GDP and total_expenditure

summary(interaction_model_GDP_total_expenditure)

```
# coefficients:

1- (**Intercept**): The model predicts that when all variables GDP, and total expenditure are zero  , life expectancy equals 6.435e+01 years. and for **intercept** The p-value is less than 5% , which indicates that this estimate is statistically significant.

2- **GDP**: The model shows that for each unit increase in GDP, life expectancy increases by5.230e-01 years, holding all other factors constant. The  p-value less than 5% indicates a statistically significant relationship between GDP and life expectancy and we can reject null hypothesis.


**WHO$total_expenditure:WHO$gdp** : The model shows that the effect of gdp on the life expectency changes by -1.795e-05 when total_expenditure increases by one unit. the p-values indictes that relationship between GDP and life expectancy varies depending on the level of total expenditure.


#Hypothesis Testing using ANOVA 

```{r }
#Null Hypothesis: GDP and Total Expenditure do not significantly affect life expectancy.
#Alternative Hypothesis: At least one of GDP or Total Expenditure significantly affects life expectancy. 
anova_result <- aov(life_expectancy ~ total_expenditure * gdp, data = WHO)
# View the summary of the ANOVA results
summary(anova_result)
```

#Explanation of hypothesis testing using ANOVA

#Evaluating each factor
total_expenditure: The F value of 63.45 indicates that total expenditure has a significant effect on life expectancy.
The p-value (3.05e-15) is much less than 0.05, indicating that you can reject the null hypothesis for total expenditure. This means total expenditure significantly affects life expectancy.
gdp: The F value of 360.79 suggests a very strong effect of GDP on life expectancy. The p-value (< 2e-16) is extremely small, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis for GDP as well. This indicates that GDP significantly affects life expectancy.
total expenditure:gdp: The F value of 9.18 indicates a significant interaction between total expenditure and GDP regarding their combined effect on life expectancy. The p-value (0.00248) is less than 0.01, suggesting that the interaction effect is statistically significant. This means that the effect of total expenditure on life expectancy is influenced by the level of GDP.

Meaning: Both total expenditure and GDP have significant effects on life expectancy. There is a significant interaction effect between total expenditure and GDP, meaning that the impact of total expenditure on life expectancy varies depending on the level of GDP. These results all suggest that we can reject the null hypothesis that GDP and Total Expenditure do not significantly affect life expectancy.


# Visualizing the Interaction
```{r}

ggplot(WHO, aes(x = gdp, y = life_expectancy, color = cut(total_expenditure, 5))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

The figure shows that the the effect of GDP on the life expectancy really depends on the total expenditure value 



# Visualizing the Interaction based on the value of total_expenditure
```{r}

# Create a new variable 'expenditure_group' by cutting 'total_expenditure' into 5 groups
WHO$expenditure_group <- cut(WHO$total_expenditure, 5)

ggplot(WHO, aes(x = gdp, y = life_expectancy, color = expenditure_group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~ expenditure_group) # create separate panels for each level of 'expenditure_group' 
```

# confedence interval for for coefficient the multi_model_gdp_status Model

```{r}
 
 confint(multi_model_gdp_status)

```

1- We can see that the confidence interval for the intercept ranges from 6.420144e+01 to 6.630828e+01. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true value of the intercept lies within this range.

2- Similarly, the confidence interval for GDP is between 2.910889e-04 and 3.583137e-04, indicating that we can be 95% confident that the true effect of GDP on life expectancy falls within this interval.

3- According to total expenditure, the confidence interval for total expenditure is between 2.083665e-01 and 5.438757e-01, indicating that we can be 95% confident that the true effect of total expenditure on life expectancy falls within this interval.

Since the confidence intervals for the intercept, GDP, and total expenditure do not include zero, we can reject the null hypothesis, which suggests that there is a statistically significant relationship between GDP, total expenditure, and life expectancy.

```

1- Confidence Interval for **intercept**seems to be slightly small. This indicates that the intercept is not very precise estimated..

Similarity, the Confidence Interval for GDP and total expentiture are tiny. This indicates that the 
GDP is precise estimated.

#Analysis of Model Diagnostics

Q-Q plot: The Q-Q plot shows that the residuals follow the red line fairly closely, representing a normal distribution, which is an assumption of linear regression.
Residuals vs. Fitted: In the residuals vs. fitted plot, the red line is not flat, the red line is curved, which suggests that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables might not be well-captured by the model, meaning there could be non-linearity. 
Scale-Location: The scale-location plot shows the red line is upward slanting and the residuals are clustered at one end of the plot and become more spread out as the plot moves along. The scale-location plot suggests heteroscedasticity because the red line is not flat but shows a distinct trend, indicating that the variance of the residuals is not constant across fitted values.
Cook's Distance: None of the observations reach a Cook's distance of 1, so there are no significant observations that are influencing the model. However, it is important to note the spike of observations at around 800, because this data could be affecting the model because of the volume of observation numbers.#Model Diagnostics.
